# StoreSalesPrediction

Store Sales Prediction is an Machine Learning based project which is able to predict the sales of item from particular outlet with the help of input data.


### AIM : 
To make a solution which is able to predit the Sales of Item from particular outlet.

### Goal :

Use Machine Learning to make this solution as well with the help of Data Analysis (EDA) understand the data, and once when we found solution then deploy that solution as Web-App.

## Approch

- Get the data from resource.
- Understand the data (in general).
- Perform some EDA to understand the cusomters behaviour.
- Preprocess the data.
- Do Feature Engineering and Feature Selection. 
- Make Different-Different model according the behaviour of data.
- Get the best model and tune that model.
- Deploy that model as Web-App


## Tech Stack

- **Python**  - as a technology, which is back support of all things like Python gives the support to all the operations.
- **EDA**     - for Data Analysis, so that we can understand the data in better way.
- **Machine Learning** -  to make a different-different models on the data.
- **Streamlit** - for making a Web-App.
- **Heeroku** - for deploying that solution so, that anyone can use the solution easily.



## Demo


## Steps

- Get the `Raw Data` from directory.
- `Raw Data Feature Classification` to seprate the different types of features present in data.
- `Data Validation` to validate the raw data.
- `Data Preprocessing` to preprocess the raw data for further use.
- `Feature Engineering` to scaling the data and split that data for model.
- `Preprocessing`, `Feature Engineering` and `Feature Selection` all these things done with the help of `EDA`
- `Model Building` to build and select the best model.
- Use `Logger` to log every activity.
- `Notebook` which contains entire basic flow of project.
- `app.py` make an Web-App and deploy the app on Heroku.


## Future Scope

- Use multiple Algorithms.
- Do more data crunching
- Optimize app.py
- Work on Front-End
